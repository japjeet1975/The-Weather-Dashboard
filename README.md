# assignment6 - The Weather Dashboard

The purposed of this website is to allowe user to view the weather of a city they chose . 

When user clicks on the Search button , on the right top side, the current date temperature , wind , hunidty and UV index will be shown .
The UV Index will be highlighted in different colours as per the UV index of the city at that time . 

Below , the 5 day forcast will be shown , under each date , with the temperature , wind and humidity % . 

I used openweather API to pull the current weather , 5 day forcast , the attributes of the weather displayed .

If user enters a wrong city name , alert will be popped up saying to "enter valid city name "

To display the UV index, I had to use a another UV API from openweather app and took the longitudes and latitudes of the city to display the UV Index .

The 5 day forcast section was created dynamically through JS. 

The Styling was done through Bootstrap. 

The searched city names are displayed on the left hand side. If user wants to click again on previously searched cuty name , they can click on the city name and the current and 5 day weather forecast will be displayed.
